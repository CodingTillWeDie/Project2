1. CS 2400 Project 2 done by Hemil Bhavsar, Kevin Kim, and Sean Abi Saab.
2. Kevin Kim created a document that shows the answers for Task #1 and Task #4 after completing both of those tasks. He also implemented the StackInterface.java, LinkedStack.java, ResizableArrayStack.java and Calculator.java. Inside the Calculator.java, he finished implementing the algorithms for the "convertToPostfix" method and "evaluatePostfix" method.

// NOTE: We are only considering addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operators will be used on integers. We will also consider open and close curly parentheses (()), but exponenetation will be excluded from this project. Furthermore, we will assume that the infix expressions will always be valid.
